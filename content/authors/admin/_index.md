I’m a researcher interested in causality, actionability and transportability of machine learning systems. 
At K Health, I design and develop models for personalised, reliable and accessible healthcare. 
In my research at Uri Shalit’s lab I devised algorithms for robust causal inference from non-experimental data. I completed an MSc in Data Science and a BSc in Electrical Engineering, both at the Technion. 
I'm an amateur sourdough baker and handtool woodworker.
